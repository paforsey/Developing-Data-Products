## Objective

The objective is to devleop a web based application that calculates a score
that enables the company to effectively segments loan applicants into three 
groups of risk based on expected losses.


## Scoring

The Audit Risk Score application leverages the following attributes:

- Loan Amount
- Wholesale Value
- Vehicle Profile ( New/Used, Vehicle Age, & Mileage )

## Segmentation


```{r echo=F}

    suppressWarnings(library(ggplot2))
    dataset <- read.csv("~/Business Analytics/Losses.csv")
    g <- ggplot(data=dataset, aes(dataset$Score, dataset$Losses))
    g <- g + geom_point(aes(color=Risk.Group), size=4, alpha=0.50)
    g <- g + labs(title="Risk Segmentation") + labs(x="Audit Risk Score", y="Losses (%)")
    g <- g + geom_smooth(size=0.75, linetype=6, col="blue", data=dataset, method="lm", se=F)
    g <- g + theme_bw()
    g

```


## Conclusions

The Audit Risk Score application correlates fairly well with actual losses, 
enabling the company to effectively segment applicants into the following three 
groups:

- Risk Group A:  500 - 660
- Risk Group B:  661 - 700
- Risk Group C:  700+
